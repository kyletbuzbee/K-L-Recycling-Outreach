LID-00001,CID-TYL144,tyler radiator shop,02/11/2026,"Talked to the new owner Miguel and he showed me around his shop and all the radiators he had. He typically holds on to it fo about 2 years before selling and he sold about a year ago and has been a little slow so its not quite where he wants it. He typically has people who stop by and bid on his pile, but I wouldnt feel comfortable doing that, so I would need Corey with me . He also has a really big pile of tin that he is wanting to get rid of, and was going to grab his trailer and load it all up and go to Dallas. The only issue is that his corner neighbor wont let him drive a truck on their property so there is no way of dropping a roll off container there. The muffler shop has an entrance, enough for a truck to pull up and we just throw the scrap in the bin, but he would have to talk to the owner to make sure it is okay to do that. He is wanting to do that relatively soon, so I need to get a plan together  so that he doesnt take his scrap to Dallas and we get it.",Interested (Warm),Nurture,Interested (Warm),02/24/2026,0,13,Interested (Warm),See Notes,Kyle Buzbee,TRUE,Visit,FALSE,None
